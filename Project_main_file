-- Step 1: Create university_professors table (source table)
CREATE TABLE university_professors (
    firstname TEXT,
    lastname TEXT,
    university TEXT,
    university_shortname CHAR(3),
    university_city TEXT,
    function TEXT,
    organization TEXT,
    organization_sector TEXT
);

-- Step 2: Create UNIVERSITIES table
CREATE TABLE universities (
    id CHAR(3) PRIMARY KEY,
    university TEXT NOT NULL,
    university_city TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Insert unique data into UNIVERSITIES table
INSERT INTO universities (id, university, university_city)
SELECT DISTINCT university_shortname, university, university_city
FROM university_professors;

-- Step 3: Create PROFESSORS table
CREATE TABLE professors (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    firstname TEXT NOT NULL,
    lastname TEXT NOT NULL,
    university_id CHAR(3) REFERENCES universities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Insert unique data into PROFESSORS table
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_id)
SELECT DISTINCT firstname, lastname, university_shortname
FROM university_professors;

-- Step 4: Create ORGANIZATIONS table
CREATE TABLE organizations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    organization TEXT NOT NULL,
    organization_sector TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Insert unique data into ORGANIZATIONS table
INSERT INTO organizations (organization, organization_sector)
SELECT DISTINCT organization, organization_sector
FROM university_professors;

-- Step 5: Create AFFILIATIONS table
CREATE TABLE affiliations (
    organization_id INT NOT NULL,
    function TEXT NOT NULL,
    professor_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (organization_id, professor_id)
);

-- Insert data into the AFFILIATIONS table
INSERT INTO affiliations (organization_id, function, professor_id)
SELECT 
    org.id AS organization_id,
    university_professors.function AS function,
    prof.id AS professor_id
FROM university_professors AS university_professors
JOIN professors AS prof 
    ON university_professors.firstname = prof.firstname 
    AND university_professors.lastname = prof.lastname
LEFT JOIN organizations AS org 
    ON university_professors.organization = org.organization;

--SHOW RESULTS IN AFFILATIIONS
SELECT * FROM affiliations;
